# BeatlesClassifySpotify
A small project to use a K nearest neighbours classifier and the Spotify API to find the closest Beatles song to any song and classify it into an album based on the five nearest songs.

I used the Python library Spotipy to get the individual song data, and I got an excel file of all the Beatles Spotify song data from https://www.kaggle.com/chadwambles/allbeatlesspotifysongdata2009remaster
